This repository contains the code of serving a model created for the academic project for Neural Networks and Deep Learning (NNDL) course.

In order to use this app, `m1.h5` model should be added to the root directory of this project.

This is a flask flask app that is able to utilize the m1.h5 model to classify the given image into one of the predetermined classes.

The source code of the training the model along with the model isn't available via open sourced yet. But this code can be tweaked to suit your requirements.
